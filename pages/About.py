The DSHI (Heart Disease Prediction) project was aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
The domain area was Health and the project used a dataset from Kaggle containing various lifestyle and health metrics.
These health metrics included age, sex, chest pain type, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina,
and a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. I chose F1-score as the evaluation metric
as it balances precision and recall.KNN-7 was selected as it had a better F1-score compared to other models.
